Overview
========


This directory contains an interface to gfanlib, a C++ library by Anders Jensen derived off his stand-alone system Gfan.
The interface allows the usage of some basic convex-geometrical structures inside of Singular, namely cones, fans and polytopes.
Moreover, it contains features, which allows the computation of tropical varieties.
